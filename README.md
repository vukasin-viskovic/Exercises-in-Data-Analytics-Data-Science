# Exercises and Projects

This is the location where I'll be submitting my **R**/**Python**/**SQL** code for various exercises and projects I'll be doing.

I hope this directory will serve as a display of my skills in these programming languages.

I will be enhancing, updating and re-structuring this content, slowly adding more of my own projects and data explorations.

## Content:

### [50 Coding Challenges](https://github.com/vuxvix/Exercises-in-Data-Analytics-Data-Science/blob/master/Coding%20Problems/README.md)
