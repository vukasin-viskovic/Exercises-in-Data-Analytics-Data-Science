## This Course's Goal:

- Learning what data structures and algorithms are the most appropriate to use in a particular situation.
    - e.g.: When is a *list* the best solution? 
    - When is it a *linked list*, or a *binary search tree*, or a *graph*?

- Cool [resource](https://csrgxtu.github.io/2015/03/20/Writing-Mathematic-Fomulars-in-Markdown/) for writing mathematical expressions in markdown.
