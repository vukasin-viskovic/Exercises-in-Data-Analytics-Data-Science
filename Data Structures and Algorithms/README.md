## This Course's Goal:

- Learning what data structures and algorithms are the most appropriate to use in a particular situation.
- We will deal with questions such as:
    - When is a *list* the best solution to a problem? 
    - When is it a *linked list*, or a *binary search tree*, or a *graph*?
